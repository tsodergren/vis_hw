*Note:

I had to edit the data/fifa-world-cup.csv file in order to fix discrepencies. These are mainly due to historical changes in geography but there were also some errors.
You must use my edited file for this document to execute properly.

The changes are as follows:

1. Changed the code for Korea DPR (North Korea) to the proper value of PRK.
2. Implemented a filler code of "ZZZ" for the former Yugoslavia as there is no current country for it.
3. Entered code for Czech Republic for missing Czechoslovakia entries.
4. Entered GBR (United Kingdom) for all instances of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
5. Entered CIV for Ivory Coast.
6. Entered COG for Zaire which is now Congo.
7. Entered IDN for Dutch East Indies which is now Indonesia.
